summary: >
    Wilensky uses levels in a manner similar to scaffolding, meaning one piece of knowledge
    builds upon another to add to learning.  This concept can be seen in differently using graphs
    of knowledge bases.  Wilensky proposes the StarLogo modelling language to help students
    understand and work with levels.  Some information about StarLogo can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarLogo
