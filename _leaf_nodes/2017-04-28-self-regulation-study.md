summary: >
  In this study, we look at how children learn self-regulatory strategies from a model. Children first observe a model playing a game with the experimenter, which involves waiting for a nicer bigger sticker or ringing the bell to stop waiting and only get one small sticker. The model uses waiting strategies like pushing the sticker away or singing. We then let the child play the same game and a novel game and see whether they imitate any waiting strategies from the model. This study takes about 15 minutes in total and the childâ€™s behavior will be videotaped.
