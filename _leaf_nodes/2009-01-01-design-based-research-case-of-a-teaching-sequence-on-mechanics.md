summary: >
    The authors present a framework to develop design-based research. Using mechanics as the subject,
    the authors describe how design-based research can be used to develop teaching resources. Then
    they explain how the theory guides the design of everything they needed to apply the
    theory in a classroom to teach students the subject matter.
