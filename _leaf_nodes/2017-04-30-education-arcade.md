     We're all about transforming kids into creators and explorers. We provide fun and accessible ways to explore real and virtual worlds, experiment with technology and use games to build math and science skills. The games, simulations and tools we develop in the Education Arcade are designed with the educator in mind. They use technology to create powerful learning environments in schools, in the home and in the community.
