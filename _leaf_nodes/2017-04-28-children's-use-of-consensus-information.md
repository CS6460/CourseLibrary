summary: >
  This is a short five to ten minute study where kids watch videos about someone doing an action (specifically crushing a cookie). We then see whether or not the child follows the modelâ€™s choice in the video or decides to use a different tool to crush the cookie. Another similar task is done, and later we ask the child to teach a puppet how to crush the cookie. The child will get a sticker for completing this five minute study.
