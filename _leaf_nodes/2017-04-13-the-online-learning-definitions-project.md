    "The Online Learning Definitions Project is designed to provide states, districts, online programs,
    and other organizations with a set of definitions related to online and blended learning in order to
    develop policy, practice, and an understanding of and within the field. The initiative began with a
    thorough literature review of existing definitions, followed by a research survey to iNACOL members
    and experts to ensure the efficacy of the definitions adopted."
