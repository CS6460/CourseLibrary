summary: >
  Across the country, colleges and universities are either starting to offer MOOCs (massively open online courses) or strategizing about how they might do so. At the same time, teachers and scholars of education are increasingly aware of the importance of collaboration and peer learning. How can students work together in this new generation of online courses? And how can the online systems support and encourage peer learning? A new School of Information research project aims to answer these questions and more.
