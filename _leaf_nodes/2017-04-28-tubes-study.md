summary: >
  The child is shown different sets of tubes and told one tube is blocked so the marble canâ€™t go through and the other tube is not blocked so the marble can go through. When deciding which color of tube to choose, the child gets help from two puppets. The oral puppet asks her friend and says one certain color and the text puppet reads the color off an envelope in front of the tubes. We expect pre-readers to prefer the oral puppet and readers to prefer the text puppet.
