summary: >
    "Stanford University School of Medicine and its affiliated hospitals are home to world
    pioneers of techniques, technologies and applications for Immersive and Simulation-based
    Learning (ISL)."  CISL simulation-based learning is accomplished using devices that put
    medical students into real-life situations.  Instead of being a pure software simulation, these
    also include mechanical and electrical interfaces.
