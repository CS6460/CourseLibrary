summary: >
  Quest2Teach is a series of game-infused curricula and social- professional network designed specifically for teacher education to help bridge between educational theory and its application into the field (handout). Pre-service teachers (university students) and in- service teachers evolve their professional identity in a variety of narrative-based 3D role-playing scenarios, each with a particular theoretical focus, and embedded within a larger experience-based curricula and professional network.
