summary: >
    This is a landing page for the MelodyMorph project at MIT Media Labs' Lifelong Kindergarten.
    As the name suggests the goal is constructing music and melodies, but in a situational and
    improvised manner by removing the fixed mapping between space and pitch. There is one paper
    about the project by Eric Rosenbaum listed on the page, but it claims to be ongoing.
