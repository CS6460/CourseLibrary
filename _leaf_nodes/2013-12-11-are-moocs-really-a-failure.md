    While MOOCs may not have failed, they have not lived up to the now incredible
    claims of their pioneers.  Sebastian Thrun's Udacity program, the University of
    Pennsylvania's international MOOC study, a New York Times article, and another
    article in Forbes are referenced in this article.
