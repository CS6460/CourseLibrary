    "It should be clear that I am skeptical as to the reality of the claims of
    educational technologists when it comes to the ability of technology to
    transform — literally to create or generate a context that was heretofore
    unknown — teaching and learning. These approaches to using technologies are
    just older pedagogical strategies cloaked in digitization. This is important;
    we should be able to distinguish what is going on here in education."
