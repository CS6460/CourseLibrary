summary: >
    Guzdial identifies three ways constructionism for adults is different than
    constructionism for children.  First, adults need to be able to safely be able to make
    mistakes and learn from them, as a child would.  Second, adults come with a presumption
    of expertise, which is not generally how a child is taught.  Third, adults have time
    constraints and responsibilities children do not have, which conflicts with the
    inherently inefficient nature of constructionism.
