    "In the coming decade, experts say, college students should expect an increased
    presence of online classes at traditional nonprofit schools. Already, about 30
    percent of American college students take at least one course online, says Elaine
    Allen, statistical director of the Sloan Survey on Online Education, which monitors
    student involvement in online higher education."
