# Tips For The Class: Finding Sources and Articles

We've provided a number of sources on a variety of topics to get you started
in your research. Chances are, however, that you're going to need to delve
deeper into these topics, and likely deeper into narrower portions of these
topics, to get the information necessary to contextualize your project.
This will mean finding sources outside of those that are provided in this library.

For example, we have a section in this library on project-based learning.
Project-based learning is a massive field, however, and you're going to
likely want to implement it within some particular context, like middle
school ecology or graduate-level computer science. That will mean drilling
down into how that methodology has been used specifically for those groups.

Finding sources can be difficult, however. Here are some tips we've picked up over the years:

##  Tip #1: Use Google Scholar

If you're not familiar with [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/) already,
you're going to fall in love with it very quickly. Google Scholar is Google's
search engine for academic publications (as well as patents and some other formal
information). It gives you the ability to filter by dates, and generally has a
pretty good keyword search. It may not find you exactly the article you want,
but it will usually find you one that will help you get started with the next couple tips.

Note also that you can use Google Scholar to search for specific authors as well
using the [author search tool](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors).
For example, [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?mauthors=David+Joyner&amp;hl=en&amp;view_op=search_authors)
are the search results for my name, and [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yaCigtkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en)
is my author page on Google Scholar.

##  Tip #2: Follow the Reference List

Once you've found one article that's at least close to what you want to find,
go to its reference list. You'll typically find dozens of references to other
articles. With luck, one or more of these will be closer to what you actually
want to find. Like a trail of breadcrumbs, you can follow these citation lists
through the history of a community.

Some article hosts will actually parse and show the references as hyperlinks to
those articles elsewhere on the host or on the internet. Other times, you'll
need to return to Google Scholar and search for the title.

##  Tip #3: Follow the Authors

Similarly, just as you can use an article's reference list to find similar
articles that might be closer to what you want, you can also simply trace
back through the author's own publication history. Search for the author's
name, and you'll generally find either their personal web site with their
CV and articles or their profile on some aggregator, like Google Scholar
or ResearchGate. Then, you can go back through their own articles.

For example, you might at some point come across an article that builds on
a claim the author has made in the past. That claim made in the past might
actually be what you want to read about, so look back through that author's
publication history to find when they may have originally made that claim.

##  Tip #4: Use the Georgia Tech Library

Oftentimes when you're searching on Google Scholar, you'll come across many
articles which you cannot directly access. Sometimes the abstract gives you
all you need to know, but other times you want to see the rest of the article.
In these cases, the [Georgia Tech Library](http://www.library.gatech.edu/)
will often have a subscription to that journal, allowing you free access to
the article so long as you're logged in through the library. See the library
web site for more information.

Remember, though, that when accessing articles that require your Georgia Tech
login, you shouldn't share them with any non-Georgia Tech students.

##  Tip #5: Ask!

If there's some topic about which you're interested in learning more but you
just can't seem to find some information, don't hesitate to ask! Ask on the
class forum especially: your classmates may have found some sources in which
you'd be interested, and they might be interested in what you find as well.
That may also help you find other people with similar interests for future
collaborations.
