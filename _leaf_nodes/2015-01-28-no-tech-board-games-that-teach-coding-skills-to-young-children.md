summary: >
    Showing educational technology doesn't need to be hi-tech, Mindshift highlights Code Monkey Island
    and Robot Turtles as ways some are teaching the thinking required to accomplish
    programming tasks. Unlike traditional children's games, these games are played cooperatively
    with cards facing up.  Fundamentally, the games teach logical and sequential organization
    to preschoolers, the target market for the games.
