    The author discusses simulations and games as teaching tools. As examples, she uses
    Jane McGonigal's creation for the World Bank Institute called Evoke, a game created
    by the principal of the American International School of Budapest called SimCEO, a
    teacher who uses World of Warcraft, and another teacher who has a weekly podcast
    about the topic of games to teach other teachers how to use them.  Links to all are
    in the article.
