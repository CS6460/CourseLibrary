summary: >
  This paper argues that education should become more evidence-based. The distinction is made between using existing research and establishing high-quality educational research. The need for highquality systematic reviews and appraisals of educational research is clear. Evidence-based education is not a panacea, but is a set of principles and practices for enhancing educational policy and practice.
