    While brainstorming this class, we came up with a few sample ideas for possible projects. Note that you absolutely do not need to choose a project from the list below, and in fact, we'd encourage you to create your own project idea. These are just some ideas to get you started, and if one catches your eye, you can feel free to actually pursue it.
