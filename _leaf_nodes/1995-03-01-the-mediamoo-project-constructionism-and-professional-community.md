summary: >
    This paper describes the MediaMOO project as "a text-based, networked, virtual reality
    environment designed to enhance professional community amoung media researchers." They
    describe constructionism as essentially people learn best when they are learning what's
    important to them, i.e. learning by doing is better than learning by being told, and a
    virtual world is a very good way to get encourage constructionist learning.
