    "There is something that bothers us about conversations about replacing face-to-face
    teaching with online learning: they often fall into a trap of assuming that incorporating
    synchronous interaction is the optimal way to make learning more personable, that it
    approximates the face-to-face setting closest, and is therefore preferable and better.
    More often than not, synchronous interaction here implies some form of two-way audiovisual
    interaction, even though there are text-only forms of synchronous interaction (e.g.,
    Twitter live chat). There are also asynchronous forms of audiovisual interaction (e.g.,
    voicemail, recorded lectures)."
