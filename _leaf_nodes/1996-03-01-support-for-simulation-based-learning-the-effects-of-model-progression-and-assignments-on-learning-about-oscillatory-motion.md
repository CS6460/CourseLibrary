summary: >
    An oscillation simulator was used to better understand the process of discovery learning,
    an educational process simulation-based learning seems well-suited to support.  The results
    of the experiment were generally positive, with significant improvement in intuitive knowledge
    and a small gain in definitional knowledge.
