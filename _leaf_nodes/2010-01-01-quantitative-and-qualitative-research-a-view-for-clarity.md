summary: >
     This paper compares and contrasts two different approaches utilized in research on education: quantitative and qualitative research. A description of these two approaches is followed by a discussion of how the components of these two approaches differ. Philosophical assumptions, methods/types, purposes/goals, question/hypotheses, those being researched, those conducting the research, and data/data analysis are examined. In order to enhance the understanding of these different approaches, two service-learning research projects are discussed with a focus on these components. Finally, what is gained and lost with each approach is presented.
