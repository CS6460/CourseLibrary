summary: >
     This was a pilot study to examine adding student preference to the ASSISTments platform.  The purpose of this study was to see if providing students a choice in feedback style would alter performance and learning gains.  Can students gauge whether video or text is best for their learning? Should students be given more control of their education?  This study used a 2x2 crossover design, with two feedback mediums (video or text) crossed with two conditions (choice or no choice).  Those in the experimental condition were asked to choose their feedback medium, while those in the control were randomly assigned to one of the two types of feedback.
