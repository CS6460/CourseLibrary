summary: >
     The history of computer-based learning games has a story arc that rises dramatically, and then plummets steeply. In the early days of personal computers, creative minds drawn to the new medium explored a variety of approaches to learning games, ranging from behaviorist drill-and-practice exercises, to open- ended environments suitable for either exploration or construction. Early practitioners were inventing new forms, and even the fundamentally limited drill- and-practice games were infused with a measure of creative energy and humor. For users of these early products, each new title represented another interesting step into unknown territory.
