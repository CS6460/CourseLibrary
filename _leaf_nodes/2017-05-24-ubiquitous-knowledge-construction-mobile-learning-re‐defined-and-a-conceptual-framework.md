summary: >
  Emerging from recent mobile technologies, mobile learning, or m‐learning, is beginning to offer ‘stunning new technical capabilities’ in education. This new genre of learning is viewed as a revolutionary stage in educational technology. However, ubiquitous computing technologies have given rise to several issues. This article revisits the relevant definitions and provides a conceptual framework of ubiquitous knowledge construction in light of contemporary research and theory. The framework can be used to assist educators and researchers who are examining the specific implications of mobile learning.
