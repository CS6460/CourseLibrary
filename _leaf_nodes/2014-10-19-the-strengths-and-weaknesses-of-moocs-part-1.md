    Tony Bates directs an education oriented consultancy and has written extensively about
    MOOCs and online education.  His personal blog (https://www.tonybates.ca/author/tony-bates/) may be of interest.
    The following quote is from the referenced article: "Because at the time of writing most MOOCs are less
    than three years old, there are not many research publications on MOOCs, although
    research activities are now beginning to pick up. Much of the research so far on
    MOOCs comes from the institutions offering MOOCs, mainly in the form of reports
    on enrolments. The commercial platform providers such as Coursera and Udacity
    have provided limited research information overall, which is a pity, because
    they have access to really big data sets. However, MIT and Harvard, the founding
    partners in edX, are conducting some research, mainly on their own courses. There
    is very little research to date on cMOOCs, and what there is is mainly qualitative."
