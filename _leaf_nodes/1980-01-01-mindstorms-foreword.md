summary: >
    This is the foreward from the classic, Mindstorms, by Seymour Papert.  In this section, Papert describes the origins
    of the book in his own childhood and how it related directly to Piaget's theories of learning.  Something is easy only if
    someone has already incorporated that into their model of things they can learn.  The copy of the document is missing
    some pieces and may not be a clean read.  The link to the book on Amazon is here https://www.amazon.com/Mindstorms-Children-Computers-Powerful-Ideas/dp/0465046746
