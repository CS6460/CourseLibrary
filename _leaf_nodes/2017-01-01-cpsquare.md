summary: >
  The idea of CPsquare is mutual motivating to learning new things, achieving determined goals in specific time frame and developing skills in certain areas. The idea came into being in the USA and is somewhat similar to discussion brainstorming, which aims at getting to know the opinions of the community members and drawing important conclusions for the future joint study. Each member shares his or her goals that they want to achieve in the nearest future as well as limitations and others control their progress and try to help by motivating and indicating appropriate ways. Moreover, the members of the community allow to divide tasks from the most important to the ones that can be quit. They help to notice, which activities do not bring the expected results and convince not to lose energy for them.
