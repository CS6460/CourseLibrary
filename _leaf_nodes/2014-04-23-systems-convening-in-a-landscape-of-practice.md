summary: >
  During the webinar, Bev and Etienne talk about the discipline of systems convening -- a new leadership for the 21st century -- and explore the challenges systems convers face as they forge partnerships to open new avenues for learning, ultimately reconfiguring the landscape as they find solutions to complex problems. They share their experience and hope to hear from others whose work could be seen as that of systems convening.
