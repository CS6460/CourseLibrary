    "Abstract.  Since online learning has a different setting from the conventional classroom,
    online educators need to use some special techniques and perceptions to lead
    to  success.  Moreover,  adults  have  special  needs  and  requirements  as  learners
    compared with children and adolescents, thus online educators should know
    how adults can learn best because of their special characteristics. Philosophical
    and  methodological  shifts  also  affect  instruction.  Many  researchers  have
    suggested that constructivism should be applied in distance education. Thus,
    this paper attempts to examine the impact of constructivism in online learning
    environments when focusing on adult learners. The author develops the connection
    between  constructivism  and  adult  learning  theory.  In  addition,  the
    paper  proposes  instructional  guidelines  using  the  constructivist  approach
    in online learning for adults."
