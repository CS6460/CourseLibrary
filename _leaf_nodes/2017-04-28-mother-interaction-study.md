summary: >
  We are currently conducting a study in our lab space looking at mother-child interaction. Specifically, we focus on the types of questions children ask, the explanations parents give and the follow-up questions that children ask. This study involves the child and mother playing with some novel toys and reading a book with strange events. Later on, the experimenter presents some strange stimuli (e.g. hat with a hole) to the child and depending on whether the child asks a questions, provides them with either a good or a bad explanation. Later on we introduce the child to a puppet that asks questions about the strange stimuli and we see whether the child has learned from the previous explanations. This study takes about one hour and is videotaped.
