summary: >
     The 2001 No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act promises a series of significant reforms. The hope is that these reforms will jump-start under-performing American schools. Most public discussion of the Act has focused on the mandate for test-based school accountability and the federal endorsements of charter schools and other forms of school choice. Other important provisions include changes in funding rules for states and a new emphasis on reading instruction. The NCLB Act also repeatedly calls for education policy to rely on a foundation of scientifically based research. Although this appears to be a bland technical statement, it strikes me as potentially at least as significant as other components of the Act.
