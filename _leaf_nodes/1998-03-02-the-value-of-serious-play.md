      Abstract The affective domain deals with how an individual makes choices. Motivation concerns the reasons - motives - that incite a person to take action. Although the field of instructional technology has traditionally distinguished the "why to learn" from the "what and how to learn," we take a more holistic view and feel that learning and motivation are but two parts of same issue. Each is needed to define the other. In particular, we are interested in those times when a person chooses to devote enormous time, energy, and emotion to a task. Interestingly, one word aptly describes such episodes - play. In this paper, we propose play as a suitable goal for those situations requiring children or adults to engage in creative higher-order thinking coupled with intense personal commitment and involvement. Current trends in the design of interactive computer-based technologies offer unique opportunities to support serious play for learning.
