Choosing between qualitative and quantitative research is not always an easy task.
There are some variables and phenomena that seem like they may be measurable numerically,
but that really should be described qualitatively before trying to create valid constructs.
The sources below should help you choose whether qualitative or quantitative research is right
for you. Note that qualitative research is often used in nursing and medicine as well,
and you may see sources that talk about it in those domains; generally, the concepts
are relatively transferable.
