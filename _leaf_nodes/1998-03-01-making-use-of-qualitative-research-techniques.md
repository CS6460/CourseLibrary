summary: >
  These methods are appropriate for practical situations in which a fuller understanding of behavior, the meanings and contexts of events, and the influence of values on choices might be useful for physicians (Table 2) We describe below how ethnographic techniques might be used to gather information necessary to plan and implement administrative changes in a clinical setting.
