summary: >
  The purpose of this research was to determine advantages, challenges, and limitations of smart glasses as an educational technology. The researcher synthesized the findings of an extensive scholarly literature review, observation of smart glasses use in a K-12 classroom, and discussions with educators who were both supportive and unsupportive of the technology. Salient advantages attributable to smart glasses had a common theme of improved classroom productivity. This relied on application software appropriate for the specific learning environment and thorough familiarity with the technology. Cost, privacy concerns, and lack of professional development were noted to be significant barriers hindering innovative opportunities for smart glasses in education, including development of application software to promote 21st century skills.
