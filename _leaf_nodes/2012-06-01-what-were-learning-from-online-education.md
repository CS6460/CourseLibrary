    "Daphne Koller is enticing top universities to put their most intriguing courses
    online for free â€” not just as a service, but as a way to research how people
    learn. With Coursera (cofounded by Andrew Ng), each keystroke, quiz, peer-to-peer
    discussion and self-graded assignment builds an unprecedented pool of data on how
    knowledge is processed. "
