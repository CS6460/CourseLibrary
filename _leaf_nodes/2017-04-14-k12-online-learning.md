    "K12 offers an outstanding curriculum that enables mastery of core concepts and
    skills for all kinds of minds. The minds that are superbly gifted--or that are
    gifted in some areas and struggling in others. The minds that need to use hands
    to learn on some days, and eyes or ears on others. The minds that move faster
    or slower than average. The minds that are connected to bodies that need to run
    off steam periodically, or that are medically unable to attend a physical school.
    All kinds of minds, not just the best and brightestâ€”not just the ones that are easy
    to teach in a classroom."
