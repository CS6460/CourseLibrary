summary: >
    The paper reports taking a multiple choice test and reviewing the results of the
    test (formative assessment) improved student grades for every review episode they
    participated in vs. those in the control group who did not participate. A clicker, btw,
    is not an electronic device. It is the name of the weekly get together where the
    quize was taken and reviewed.
