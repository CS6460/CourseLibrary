    From the introduction: "This guide provides a practical approach to creating
    communities of practice (CoPs) based on experiences working with corporations,
    nonprofits, associations, government organizations, and educational institutions.
    While it is important to recognize that every  organization and community is
    different, this guide provides a structure to help clarify the most important
    design elements that go in to defining, designing, launching, and growing CoPs
    â€”both online and face-to-face."
