summary: >
    Quantitative research is all about quantifying relationships between variables. Variables are things like weight, performance, time, and treatment. You measure variables on a sample of subjects, which can be tissues, cells, animals, or humans. You express the relationship between variable using effect statistics, such as correlations, relative frequencies, or differences between means. Hopkins deals with these statistics and other aspects of analysis elsewhere at this site. In this article he focuses on the design of quantitative research. First I describe the types of study you can use. Next he discusses how the nature of the sample affects your ability to make statements about the relationship in the population. He then deals with various ways to work out the size of the sample. Finally he gives advice about the kinds of variable you need to measure.
