summary: >
    You are never required to share anything you do in this class outside the class. The only people
    with whom you are required to share your work are the members of the teaching team and your
    classmate partners during peer review.

    You are, however, allowed to share your work outside the class if you so choose. Given the
    open-ended nature of this project, we are not concerned with plagiarism by students in future
    semesters, and we are aware that your work in this class could — and hopefully will — lead to
    additional opportunities after the class is over.
