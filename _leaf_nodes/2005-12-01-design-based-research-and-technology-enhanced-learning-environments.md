summary: >
  During the past decade, design-based research has demonstrated its potential as a methodology suitable to both research and design of technology-enhanced learning environments (TELEs). In this paper, we define and identify characteristics of design-based research, describe the importance ofdesign-based research for the development of TELEs, propose principles for implementing design-based research with TELEs, and discuss future challenges of using this methodology
