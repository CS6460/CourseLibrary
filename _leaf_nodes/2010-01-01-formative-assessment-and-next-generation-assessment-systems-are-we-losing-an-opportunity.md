    This paper makes the argument a misunderstanding of formative assessment as a tool and not
    the process it is has resulted in a step away from formative assessment, when formative
    assessment is critical to both teaching and learning. Heritage prepared this report for
    the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO).
