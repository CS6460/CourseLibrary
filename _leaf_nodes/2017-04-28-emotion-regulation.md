summary: >
  This study focuses on whether emotion regulation affects a childâ€™s performance on an executive functioning task. In the first part, the experimenter plays a block game with the child, where the child imitates pointing to a certain block. The child then chooses the gift they would like to receive later, but the experimenter prepares a different/unappealing gift for them. Afterwards, the child plays the block task again. So far we have found that children perform significantly worse during the second part because they are trying to suppress their negative emotions about not receiving their favorite gift, and this affects their performance. This study takes about 10 minutes.
