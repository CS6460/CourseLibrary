summary: >
    Following the link will initiate a pdf file download.  From the introductory
    paragraph, "In this paper we discuss patterns of engagement that have emerged
    from our own research on authentic learning tasks, in particular, the initial
    reluctance to willingly immerse in learning scenarios that some students
    experience, and the need for the suspension of disbelief before engaging in
    the task. The paper proposes ten characteristics of authentic activities,
    based on educational theory and research, which have been used as criteria
    for the selection of existing online units or courses for in depth investigation."
