summary: >
  In the Social Learning Laboratory, we research childrenâ€™s use of social and cognitive information when learning about the world.  During the preschool period, the childâ€™s social horizon expands dramatically.  Increasingly, they can learn from teachers and peers as well as from their immediate family.  An issue central to both social and cognitive development is how children navigate these diverse sources of information.  An understanding of the cues that facilitate learning in young children can inform classroom practices, interventions, and the provision of digital information.
