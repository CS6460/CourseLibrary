    "Whether you are a lifelong learner pursuing personal and intellectual interests, a currently enrolled student, or an educator or researcher, we invite you to explore online learning at Harvard.

     While nothing can replace the direct, personal interactions of campus-based education, by taking advantage of new technologies and research-based pedagogy we can make teaching and learning better -- both on campus and online.

     Moreover, our commitment to equity calls on us to create effective, accessible avenues for people who desire to learn but who may not have an opportunity to obtain a Harvard education.

     We are eager to draw the attention, engagement, and commitment of learners throughout the world, providing educational offerings that are unparalleled in breadth, depth, and quality."
