     Abstract
     At its most rudimentary, validity refers to the reasons we have for believing truth claims, what Dewey called ?warranted assertibility? (Phillips, 1987). These truth claims may take the form of statements of fact, descriptions, accounts, propositions, generalisations, inferences, interpretations, judgements or arguments. Irrespective of their form what is important is why we believe the things that we do and how we justify the claims we make.
