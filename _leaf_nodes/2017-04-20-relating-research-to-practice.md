summary: >
    The goal of this site is to provide education professionals access to research
    in a location and venue they would not normally be able to access by presenting
    summaries of education research related papers. The project was initially funded
    by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in 2011 and has gone on to draw support
    from many other organizations.
