summary: >
  Despite prevalent recommendations for the adoption of problem-based learning (PBL) approaches, the transition to PBL teaching is not easy. Given the general lack of experience most teachers have with open-ended teaching strategies, novice PBL instructors are likely to encounter difficulties in all aspects of instruction: planning, implementing, and assessing. More specifically, researchers have reported that instructors experience frustration with the amount of time it takes to implement problem-based experiences, report difficulty transitioning students into more active roles, and note struggles with effectively assessing student learning.
