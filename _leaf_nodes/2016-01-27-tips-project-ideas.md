# Tips For The Class: Project Ideas

While brainstorming this class, we came up with a few sample ideas for possible projects.
Note that you absolutely do _not_ need to choose a project from the list below,
and in fact, we'd encourage you to create your own project idea. These are just some ideas to get you started, and if one catches your eye, you can feel free to actually pursue it.

## Things to Research

__Gender in the OMS:__ diSalvo’s and Guzdial’s research notes a number of obstacles
to women enrolling in the OMS: perceived animosity toward women in an online
environment, perceived questions on the quality of the program, and other issues,
leading to a higher gender disparity than on-campus programs. What differentiates
women who apply to and/or enroll in the program from those that do not?

__Retention:__ What factors predict whether students will remain in the program?
Are they characteristics of students as they enter the program? Is it something
that happens while they’re in the program? Can we improve retention, or is it
strictly a function of the students themselves?

__Student Success:__ What predicts student success? Is student success most
predicted by factors of the students as they come into the program, or are
there things that we or they can do that will improve their likelihood of success?

__Plagiarism:__ What are the motivations behind plagiarism? Are they typically
students who are overwhelmed and resort to plagiarism as a final option, or are
they typically students that look to plagiarism as a first plan? Can we prevent
it structurally (by providing the resources necessary to succeed) rather than
preventing it by catching and penalizing it?

__The Halo effect:__ Why do students react so differently to glitches and errors
in some courses than others? Sometimes students are very understanding and patient
when things go wrong, and other times they are incredibly critical. What determines
which occurs? Can we create positive environments that encourage the former rather
than the latter?

__Angels and Devils:__ Some classes have been disproportionately impacted,
positively or negatively, by the presence of certain individual students.
Can this effect be quantified and replicated or prevented?

__Breaking the Isolation:__ What experiences, especially based on interactions
with teachers and other students, do online students tend to miss out on? What
impact does that isolation have on the ultimate learning? What can we do to link
them with others to break this isolation a bit?

__Meta-Success:__ How do we define a successful class? Success at the student
level is a common idea, but how do we define a class as a whole as successful?
What metrics do we use? How do we populate those metrics? How do we validate
those metrics?

__Connectedness:__ Can we quantify how interconnected an online class is based
on observable interactions? Can we connect those models of interconnectedness
to levels of classroom success or failure? Can we make changes that encourage
those types of interconnectedness that connect to classroom success?

__Peer Feedback:__ How does peer-to-peer feedback improve the classroom experience
for participants? How does access to peer review improve the feedback students get
from graders? Does access to peer review change the grades that graders ultimately
give to students?

__The Harvard Business School (HBS) Case Method:__ The
[Harvard Business School Case Method](http://www.hbs.edu/mba/academic-experience/Pages/the-hbs-case-method.aspx)
is a way of approaching business courses to engage students. Though it was
developed at HBS other institutions leverage the methodology for teaching
their students.&nbsp; Because much of the method revolves around synchronous
discussions in the same space some faculty do not believe it is equitable to
have an online method.&nbsp; However, with many schools moving degrees online
is the belief that a video conference is equitable true?  If so does there have
to be certain settings in the setup such as the instructor being able to see all
participants while they are not talking to see their engagement level?  Can you
achieve the same outcomes with an asynchronous setup, and what would it look like?  
If nothing exists currently can something be built to achieve the same level of outcomes?  

## Things to Build

__Forums:__ We've seen fantastic forum discussions in the OMSCS program, but
at the same time, many students have noted several things about our current
forum solution that aren't ideally suited for this program and these classes.
Build a new forum system that's custom-tailored to the kind of closed, large,
instructor-led classes we have in the OMS program. Some things to consider
include: facilitating both Q&amp;A and discussions; facilitating group work;
managing information overload; facilitating both cursory browsing and in-depth search;
managing official communications; and integrating with other tools.

__Office Hours:__ Right now, we use at least three different tools for office hours in
the OMSCS program: Webex, Google Hangouts, and Google Hangouts on Air. Each has its own
benefits: the static URL and waiting room function of Webex, the easy recording and
rebroadcasting of Hangouts on Air, the simple setup of Hangouts. Additionally, all
three are missing some features we may need, like the ability to easily divide and
recombine rooms for targeted discussion. Construct a single office hours solution
that handles all the office hours uses cases we run into: 1:1 conversations,
1:many conversations, recording and rebroadcasting while remaining FERPA compliant, etc.

__Attendance:__ For financial aid and some other programs, students need to
demonstrate a certain attendance record to qualify for their aid. Attendance
has no clear meaning in an asynchronous online course, however. Develop a
definition for attendance in this context informed by the rationale behind
these requirements, then develop a system that can actually monitor for attendance
according to that definition.

__Essay Autograding:__ Can essays be autograded? We'll likely always want to
have human experts sign off on the quality of essays, but human grading takes
a while and leads to a slower feedback cycle. Develop a system that can autograde
essays based on a collection of past good and bad essays. In constructing this system,
think especially on how such an autograder could generate immediate feedback for the
writer so that they could improve the essay before submitting it. You might also extend
this idea beyond just education: imagine an auto-editor for blog posts, news articles,
or scholarly publications.

__Managing Human Grading:__ Even as we continue to rely on humans to grade written or
open-ended work, there are still a lot of places where technology can help. MOOCs rely
on peer-to-peer grading, but there are questions about its reliability. Our OMSCS classes
use expert human graders, but consistency between graders is not a given. Construct a
system that will manage the grading process and automatically identify and emphasize
more reliable peer-to-peer graders or identify and resolve differences between expert graders.

__Detecting Plagiarism:__ Tools like TurnItIn already help detect plagiarism in
written work, but with the requirement that work be then included in an archive
for future users to test against. Can plagiarism instead be detected at the local
level based solely on a canon of past work submitted in a class? There exist tools
that do similar analysis as TurnItIn for programming, but they are not yet perfectly
suited specifically for plagiarism detection. Additionally, code presents many more
fair opportunities for copying that does not constitute plagiarism. Develop a system
that addresses one of these problems, either detecting plagiarism of written work
only within a local database or detecting code plagiarism with the ability to ignore cited code.

__Identity Verification:__ The one edge case that has not yet been addressed
(that we know of) in education (online or in-person) is the possibility of
someone completing work on behalf of a student. Because the work is original,
it would not appear in any online database, but yet still would not be the
student's own work. Proctoring addresses this for short-term assignments,
but we clearly do not want to proctor a student writing a 10-page essay in a
single sitting or something. Develop a solution that would allow a school to
proctor a shorter essay, then use machine learning to determine if future
essays were written by the same student that wrote the proctored essay.

__Group Formation:__ Many classes rely on group projects, but forming students
into groups for group projects is an arduous process. Different classes have
different constraints, and different students have different priorities.
Develop a tool that could gather information about students and make recommendations
about groups based on criteria and preferences entered by students and instructors.

__Intelligent tutoring systems:__ Intelligent tutoring systems have been effective
in a number of domains, like Algebra and Geometry. Build one for a new domain!

__Academic Adviser:__ Develop an AI agent that can serve as a virtual academic
adviser for students, answering questions on things like schedule formation,
class prerequisites, readiness questions, etc. Ideally, construct it to take into
consideration the student's own personal information, recommendations and reviews
from past students, and intelligence regarding what kinds of students have succeeded
and failed in other classes to allow recommendations like, "You might want to take
Introduction to Operating Systems before taking Advanced Operating Systems".

__Remedial Classes:__ This semester, Chris Pryby of Udacity has developed a new linear
algebra refresher course to help students get prepared for classes like Computer Vision
and Computational Photography. There are other subjects that students have reflected
needing as well, like C and MATLAB. Develop a remedial course for one of these. Or,
similarly, there are likely topics in other domains and other universities on which
students need to be refreshed before moving forward. Develop a remedial class for any
other topic. Or, for that matter, one person's remedial class is another person's regular
class&nbsp;— so, develop a class!

__EdTech Library:__ Could this library work better in a different format? Perhaps
something constructed on WordPress that would allow more extensive linking and
embedding? Maybe something that would lend itself to targeted discussion on
specific topics that could then be aggregated into a more traditional forum?
Reinvent this library in a way that makes it easier to find and navigate among
topics and easier to have discussions. Remember that in doing so, you're actually
creating a solution that could be used for any library like this.

__Class Projects:__ You've taken a couple OMS courses already. Could the projects
in those courses have been improved? Do you think you could modify the project
descriptions to better bring out the learning objectives, or develop autograders
or other tools to give more immediate feedback on progress on those projects? Could
you create a tool to allow assignments for CS6505 to be completed on screen, or an
evaluator for getting instant feedback on the performance on the Test and Raven's
problems for a project in CS7637? Take a crack at redesigning those past projects.

__TA Symbiosis:__ A lot of people in this class are TAing other classes, and ideally,
many of you will go on to become TAs. A side goal for this class is that it would become
a training ground for future TAs across the program to learn about education and technology.
Use that alignment to improve the other classes on which you're working. Your EdTech project
can be improving a tool specifically for another class in which you're involved, giving you
a live test audience for whatever you develop.
