    "To find out more how these videos are being used, the Gates Foundation, one
    of Khanâ€™s biggest funders, commissioned an SRI International study on what
    works and what barriers exist to effective implementation. Researchers conducted
    a two-year study of 70 teachers in 20 California schools between 2011-2013,
    choosing sites that serve mostly low-income students. Participating schools included
    both public and charter schools and spanned the K-12 range."
