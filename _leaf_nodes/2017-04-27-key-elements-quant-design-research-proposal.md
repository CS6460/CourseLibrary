    There are four main types of Quantitative research:  Descriptive, Correlational, Causal-Comparative/Quasi-Experimental, and Experimental Research. It is easier to understand the different types of quantitative research designs if you consider how the researcher designs for control of the variables in the investigation. If the researcher views quantitative design as a continuum, one end of the range represents a design where the variables are not controlled at all and only observed.  Connections amongst variable are only described.  At the other end of the spectrum, however, are designs which include a very close control of variables, and relationships amongst those variables are clearly established. In the middle, with experiment design moving from one type to the other, is a range which blends those two extremes together.
