    This is a review of Bill Ferster's book Teaching Machines: Learning from the Intersection
    of Education and Technology. According to Wheeler, "Ferster’s focus is on
    how we can teach with “machines” of various kinds, and he exposes the issues and
    challenges that emerge whenever we apply technology to the task of pedagogy." And, in closing,
    “Teaching machines can be only as effective as the pedagogical methods they employ … and
    how they stay focused on the learner”
