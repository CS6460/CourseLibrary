summary: >
    From the course description: ""This course examines the philosophical and theoretical
    foundations of constructionism as a paradigm for formulating and evaluating new theories
    for learning and approaches to education. One of the goals of this course is to help new
    learning researchers situate their work within the constructionist framework through
    readings and projects that will focus on the rich interplay between the process of knowledge
    construction and the development and co-evolution of ideas, learners, tools, and contexts.""
    As of April 19, 2017, the course is taught by MIke Petrich, Karen Wilkinson, and Luigi Anzivino
    from Exploratorium in San Francisco, CA.
