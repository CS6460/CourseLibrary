    From the About page, "The Lighthouse Community Charter School Creativity Labâ€™s vision is to
    give people from all walks of life the opportunity to participate in designing and making.
    We are building a K-12 program on site both to serve our own students, but also to help others
    see how design-make can be integrated into an entire school program.  We believe that all
    students are designers and makers and we want to give our students the choice to pursue their
    own passion by providing them with the opportunity to make at all ages."
