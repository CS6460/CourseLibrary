summary: >
  In contrast to recent efforts to seek a singular definition for design experimentation, I argue that methodological and epistemological issues are significantly more tractable if considered from the perspective of manifold families of theoretically-framed design-based research. After characterizing a range of such families, I suggest that as we deliberate on the nature of design-based research greater attention be given to the pluralistic nature of learning theory, the relationship between theory and method, and working across theoretical and methodological boundaries through the use of mixed methods. Finally, I suggest that design-based research—with its focus on promoting, sustaining, and understanding innovation in the world—should be considered a form of scholarly inquiry that sits alongside the panoply of canonical forms ranging from the experimental, historical, philosophical, sociological, legal, and the interpretive.
