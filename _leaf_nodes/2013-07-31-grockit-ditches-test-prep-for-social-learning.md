  GigaOM reported that San Francisco-based Grockit is selling its test prep assets to Kaplan (a subsidiary of The Washington Post) and "abandoning its founding purpose all together." Not quite, says Grockit founder Farbood Nivi. "The founding purpose of Grockit was social learning," he stated in an interview with EdSurge. "Learnist is, for me, an even greater representation of the vision I had in mind when I started Grockit."
