summary: >
  As a collection, these articles depict the unique, evolving, and expanding role of design-based approaches to educational inquiry. They also highlight the pressing issues and future directions currently facing researchers making use of this methodological orientation. We believe that by bringing some much-needed clarity around the nature of design-based research to the broader readership of Educational Psychologist, it will fuel productive discussions of research methodology and modes of inquiry currently appropriate for the study of learning.
