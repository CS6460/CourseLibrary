    From the Abstract, "A systematic search of the research literature from 1996
    through July 2008 identified more than a thousand empirical studies of on line
    learning. ... The meta-analysis found that, on average, students in online
    learning conditions performed modestly better than those receiving face-to-face
    instruction. The difference between student outcomes for online and face-to-face
    classes—measured as the difference between treatment and control means, divided
    by the pooled standard deviation—was larger in those studies contrasting conditions
    that blended elements of online and face-to-face instruction with conditions
    taught entirely face-to-face."
