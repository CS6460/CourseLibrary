summary: >
  These readings and resources have been included to stimulate conversations and to guide the potential ways in which you might consider or develop a community of practice at UTAS. It is by no means an exhaustive collection, however it does contain a variety of documents pertaining to: what a community of practice is and some common ways in which one might work (Blue Section ‐ Toolkit Readings); and, how communities of practice have been applied in particular contexts within the Australian higher education landscape (Green Section ‐ Case Study Readings).
