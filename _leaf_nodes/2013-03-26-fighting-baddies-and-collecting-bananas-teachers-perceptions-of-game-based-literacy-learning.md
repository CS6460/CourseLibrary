summary: >
     This paper discusses how practicing teachers conceptualize commercial off theshelf (COTS) videogames within classroom-based English language arts instruc-tion. Understanding how today ? s teachers perceive virtual worlds and videogamesas an instructional tool for schema building within literacy development will helpresearchers better understand ways to structure games-based learning in class-room environments. Data for this study were drawn from case study research of a graduate pilot course focusing on the intersections of virtual worlds, popular culture, and literacy instruction. Findings indicate that a limited understanding of videogames and virtual worlds does not hinder practicing teachers from desiringto create engaging units of study using videogames as a schema building tool.However, teachers feel that using videogames for schema building in the class-room will lead to negative perceptions of how they are viewed as teachers. Thisis compounded by the perception that they will not receive adequate ? nancialsupport in the form of professional development from administration, nor willthey receive monies for technological support to implement within instruction.However, despite these ? ndings, teachers desire to use games-based learning andimplement it as a schema building exercises with their students.
