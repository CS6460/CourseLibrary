    "ABSTRACT: An investigation was carried out to determine the extent to which
    evidence of collaborative learning could be identified in students’ textual
    interactions in an online learning environment. The literature on collaborative
    learning has identified a range of behaviors that characterize successful collaborative
    learning in face-to-face situations. Evidence of these behaviors was sought in the
    messages that were posted  by  students  as  they  interacted  in  online  work
    groups.  Analysis  of  students’  contributions reveals  that  there  is  substantial
    evidence  of  collaboration,  but  that  there  are  differences  between
    conventional  face-to-face  instances  of  collaborative  learning  and
    what  occurs  in  an  asynchronous, networked environment."
