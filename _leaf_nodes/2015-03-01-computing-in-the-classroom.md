summary: >
    Nguyen provides a brief background on the use of machines for teaching, starting with
    behaviorist B.F. Skinner's reductionism applied to education, with the most modern example
    being gamification. Constructionism, on the other hand, involves hands-on learning, i.e.
    learning by doing, and students proceed at different speeds. This conflicts with the
    factory/production model of the current U.S. education system.
