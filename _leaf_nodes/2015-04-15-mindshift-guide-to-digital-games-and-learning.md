    As MindShift continues to cover many aspects of 
learning and the future of education, digital games 
have become a more widespread and critical tool in 
the learning and teaching experience. The MindShift 
Guide to Digital Games and Learning started as a

with support of the Joan Ganz Cooney Center at 
Sesame Workshop and the Games and Learning 
Publishing Council.
