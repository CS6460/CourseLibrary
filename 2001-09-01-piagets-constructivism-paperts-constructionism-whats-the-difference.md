summary: >
    Ackerman describes the differences between Piaget's constructivism and Papert's constructionism.
    Constructivism is a theory of how children learn at different developmental stages.
    Constructionism, on the other hand, is about learning to learn, especially typified by self-directed
    learning and learning through doing.
