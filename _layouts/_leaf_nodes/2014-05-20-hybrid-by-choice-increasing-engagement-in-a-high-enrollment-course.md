    "In many contemporary university settings, available course formats often
    present students and instructors with a binary choice in terms of participation:
    in class or online; with a rigid schedule determined by the instructor and/or
    institution. This article presents one possible innovation to that model,
    starting the process and championing the sentiment that agency must be granted
    in any reasonable way possible for progress to be made."
