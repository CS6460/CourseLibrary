summary: >
    The Harvard Gazette article discusses the results of a Harvard/MIT joint study
    about MOOC participants.  A link to the 2015 results report and the 2014 results
    report are both included in the article.  This article is interesting because rather
    than focusing on completion rates (Penn MOOC study from 2013), it's focusing on
    the participants and how MOOCs are being used.
