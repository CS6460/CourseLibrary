    This article reports on the use of an immersive video game to teach history at
    Brooklyn International High School (http://www.mybihs.org/).  The video game is
    Mission US (http://www.mission-us.org/) and it covers parts of the 18th, 19th,
    and 20th centuries.  One of the challenges in video game is avoiding bias and
    the pre-Civil War unit was questioned about whether it portrayed slavry accurately.
