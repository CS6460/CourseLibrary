    This report from the Educause Center for Applied Research (ECAR) is a high-level overview
    of simulation-based learning, covering topics such as uses, trend, and implications; using
    simulation for assessment and learning, and what it means for higher education.  It also
    includes a few questions an academic can ask about their institution's readiness to adopt
    simulation as part of the curriculum.
