    "The collection of the content for this report was made possible through the Atlas Economic Research
    Foundation to replicate and extend the 2006 International Survey conducted by iNACOL. Atlas
    worked with current education researchers in over 60 countries to answer several questions about
    the state of online learning policy and practice for primary and secondary (K-12) students in each
    country. iNACOL received a total of 50 completed surveys."
