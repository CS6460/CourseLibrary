summary: >
    Quantitative research has played an important role in TESOL for a long time, but over the years the standards have shifted somewhat. In part because of the educational role TESOL Quarterly plays in modeling research in the field, it is of particular concern that published research articles meet current standards. To support this goal, the following guidelines and references are provided for quantitative research papers submitted to TESOL Quarterly.
