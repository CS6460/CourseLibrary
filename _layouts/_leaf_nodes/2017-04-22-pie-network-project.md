    From the About page, "PIE (Playful Invention and Exploration) is an approach to using new
    technologies that integrates art, science, music, and engineering. The main goal of PIE is
    to enable and inspire more people to create, invent, and explore -- using a combination of
    traditional craft materials and new digital technologies.  Although it began as an effort
    of MIT Media Labs funded by the National Science Foundation, it is an independent project.
