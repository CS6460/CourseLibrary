summary: >
     Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are becoming an important tool for the evaluation of social policies. They borrow the principle of comparing a treated group and a control group that are chosen by random assignment from medical science, where they have been a standard since the Second World War. They provide a robust and transparent way of eliciting the causal impact of an intervention. The method is not new in educational science, especially in relation to cognitive science, but it is mostly used in very controlled, quasi-laboratory, environments, and on rather small samples.
