summary: >
    Using three of Bandura's original papers, McLeod provides an overview of social
    learning theory. Bandura took operant conditioning and classical
    conditioning and added observational learning and mediating processes to
    come to the complete theory in 1977. McLoed closes with a critical evaluation
    of social learning theory, which may also be found in later literature as
    Social Cognitive Theory.
