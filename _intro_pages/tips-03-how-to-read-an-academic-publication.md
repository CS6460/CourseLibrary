## How to Read an Academic Publication

In this course library, you'll encounter a lot of different kinds of sources:
informational web sites, white papers, media articles, and more. But likely
the most common type of source is the peer-reviewed academic publication.

Academic publications are very different from what you may have read
elsewhere, and they require some particular strategies. I'll first share
the way I think about academic publications, and then I'll share a few
other views from around the community.

In my opinion, the important thing to recognize about academic publications
is that they typically serve at least two primary functions: to make a
contribution, and to justify that contribution. Papers will often be grounded
around some claim, such as ["minimally guided instruction is likely to be ineffective"](http://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/handle/1874/16899/kirschner_06_minimal_guidance.pdf)
or ["engagement with a metacognitive tutoring system improves students' participation"](http://www.davidjoyner.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IUI2015_Camera-Ready.pdf).
A significant portion of the paper will then be spent justifying that claim based on the
analysis that has been conducted. Whether or not the claim is adequately justified is a
key factor in whether the paper passes peer review and is ultimately published.

What that means, though, is that in many cases, you the reader likely do not
need to ingest the entire paper. You are most likely interested in the claims
and contributions that the paper makes. What does it say about learning? What
does it say about existing tools? How do these claims affect my work? These
questions are all based on those ultimate claims. It's great to be able to
thoughtfully critique the methodology and analysis used to justify these
claims, but given the short period of time you have in this class, you may
want to focus primarily on the claims themselves, and leave learning to
critique methodology for another day.

Given that, here is the way I, personally, read most academic publications:

1. __Read the abstract.__ This will give you a good, high-level outline. Generally,
this will tell you if you're actually interested in reading the rest of the paper.

2. __Read the introduction.__ If you're still interested in the paper after reading
the abstract, read the introduction. Look at the structure of their argument. Map
the paper's topic in your mind to other projects with which you're familiar.

3. __Read the conclusion.__ Find out what the paper is claiming. You likely
already had an idea of this from the abstract, but read the conclusion to get it in more detail.

4. __Read other relevant sections.__ If you still have questions after reading the conclusion,
then return to the body of the paper and read further. In my experience, oftentimes you'll be
satisfied simply hearing the conclusion of the paper, and you'll be ready to move on. For
papers that are more narrowly applicable to your work, though, you may be interested in
learning more about the design of their tool or their methodology because you may want
do something similar in your own project.

The goal of this process is to ensure the majority of your time is spent in useful reading, not simply in completing reading assignments. Similarly, reading publications should be a personal experience: you should be searching for the application of what you're reading to _your_ work.
