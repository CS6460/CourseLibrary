## Publication Formats and Destinations

## Types of Publications

There are three primary types of publications in which we're interested:
technical reports, conference papers, and journal articles.


* __Technical reports__ are publications published through the Georgia Tech library.
Anyone can submit anything for publication here. Publications here are not peer-reviewed;
thus, this is mostly simply for information dissemination. Technical reports can
be of any length and any format. Any papers can be submitted using
[this form](http://d7.library.gatech.edu/scdc/SMARTech_submission),
and we highly recommend doing so!
* __Conference papers__ are publications submitted to a conference. Submissions go
through a peer review process and are either accepted or rejected. If accepted, the
author attends the conference and presents the paper. Conference papers are more
valuable than technical reports due to the peer review element, and typically range
in length from four to ten pages. A good conference paper typically reports on a small
number of interesting findings or ideas.
* __Journal articles__ go through the same process as conference submissions, but
rather than presenting the article at a conference, it is instead included in a
published journal. Journal articles follow the format of the specific journal, and
typically can be significantly longer than conference papers. Although every community
is different, they are generally considered more significant than conference papers
because they cover a larger scope of work. Very often, multiple conference papers
together form the foundation for a journal article; as such, a good journal article
reports on a broader range of discoveries or designs.


For the purpose of this class, we are most interested in conference papers:
it is unlikely that a single semester of work could generate the information
necessary to write a journal article, but we do want to do everything we can
do prepare for the peer review process. Therefore, the goal of the final papers
in this class is to generate a paper ready for submission to a conference.

## Conference Paper Formats

There exist a number of different formats for writing conference papers. In
computer science, most conferences follow either the Springer or ACM CHI
formats, although some follow their own formats. You should write the paper
in the format of the conference most appropriate for your work. The applicable
formats are linked in the following table of potentially applicable conferences.

Many conferences have different "tiers" of submissions; for example, many
conferences have "full paper" and "short paper" categories. These refer to
the length of the paper, and also the rigor expected of the contribution. A
"short paper" or "poster" would be expected to make a relatively small contribution,
whereas a "full paper" would be expected to make a larger contribution. You may
feel free to choose a length most appropriate for the maturity of your work; we
would expect that most projects would qualify at least for a short paper. Note
that "poster" does not mean you should submit a poster; rather, it means you
would submit a short paper, and if invited to present at the conference, you
would present using a poster rather than a presentation.

## Upcoming Conferences

The following table gives some upcoming conferences. As far as the final paper
for this class is concerned, you need only select the conference you think is
most applicable to your work and write a paper in its format. Deadlines, locations,
and dates are provided just in case you want to make sure to select a conference
where publishing is an option.

your conference is not listed above, it is a good idea to check with your
mentor to learn the conference's notoriety.

## Paper Content

For many of your projects, you may not be interested in publishing academically. You might be interested in instead pitching your project to start-up incubators or presenting it to users. The <em>content</em> of the paper is up to you. All papers should have an introduction, conclusion, and project description, but it is up to you whether you want the content of the paper to really qualify it for academic submission. We require you to use the above formats (a) for professionalism, (b) for consistency, and (c) for preparation for potential submission, but if you do not plan to submit your paper to a conference, you may feel free to structure the content differently.

For more details, see the final project's assignment page.
