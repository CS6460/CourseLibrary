summary: >
    Kim identifies three unspoken beliefs about educational technology carried by
    the Educational Technology community in Higher Ed. First, blind faith in the
    benefits of technology limit the ability to see the potential harm in applying
    tech-centric solutions to educational problems.  Second, technology provides metrics
    that can be used to increase productivity.  Third, technology is the solution to the
    continual removal of resources such as staff and funding.  He calls for educational
    technology to side with the educator, 'building relationships rather than transactions.'
