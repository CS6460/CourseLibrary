# Educational Technology Library

Welcome to the Educational Technology library. This library is primarily assembled as an archive of resources for the Georgia Tech OMSCS CS6460 class by the same name, but is open to use by, and contributions from, anyone who is interested in Educational Technology.

## Technical framework of the libary (GitHub pages, Jekyll, Markdown, etc)

The library is hosted by GitHub Pages, which uses the Jekyll framework to generate the site.

## Overall structure of the library

The site is composed of posts that are organized into one or more topics under one or more categories, and each category in turn is classified into one of the groups.

## Procedure for maintaining library

Posts are processed by Jekyll according to the anatomy of the YAML front matter.
