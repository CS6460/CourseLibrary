summary: >
    Bruckman argues educational, especially when it comes to games, can be fun.  The typical
    educational game did not, at the time, make learning fun.  From the Abstract, "Fun is often
    treated like a sugar-coating to be added to an educational core. Which makes about as much
    sense as chocolate dipped broccoli."
